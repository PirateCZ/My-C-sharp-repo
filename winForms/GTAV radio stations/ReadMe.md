This is a GTAV Radio Stations Emulator
plan to do-
    plan to add all stations
    plan to improve the dj experience
    plan to make ads from radio

why did I create this-
    I wanted to listen to NonStop Pop with the Dj but all youtube versions were mid at best
    So i came up with maikng my own
    I wanted as close of a representation as possible to the actual radio experience

software used to create:
    -OpenIV: used to extract sound files from GTAV
    -WMPLib: used to play songs
